# IPL Prediction Model 🏏📈  

This project is part of my internship at **Interpe**, where I developed a machine learning model to predict match outcomes and analyze trends in the **Indian Premier League (IPL)**.

## 📋 Features  
- Predict match winners using historical IPL data.  
- Analyze player and team performances.  
- Explore data trends and visualizations.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** for data processing and model building.  
- Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.  
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Feature engineering and preprocessing significantly improved prediction accuracy.  
- The model achieved **[insert accuracy]%** on test data.  
- Data visualizations revealed interesting IPL trends.  

## 🙏 Acknowledgment  
This project was made possible by the support of **Interpe** during my internship. It allowed me to explore the application of data analytics in sports—a field I’m deeply passionate about.
